DJ Mode+

DJ Mode+ brings a DJ-like, mobile-style smart play experience to Spotify Desktop using Spicetify.

It allows you to control playback, discovery and navigation using simple text commands, without touching the Spotify UI.

The extension is designed to be fast, keyboard-first and context-aware.

Main Activation

Ctrl + Space
Opens DJ Mode+ from anywhere in Spotify.

This is the primary and recommended way to use the extension.

Secondary Shortcut

Ctrl + Shift + Space
Repeats the last DJ Mode+ command instantly, without opening the input box.

Perfect for quick replays or continuing a DJ flow.

Features

Smart artist playback with memory
DJ Mode+ remembers which tracks were played per artist and cycles through them instead of repeating the same song.

Smart track detection
If you type a song name, DJ Mode+ plays that track.
If no exact track match is found, it falls back to artist mode automatically.

How DJ Memory Mode Works

When you play an artist, DJ Mode+ fetches their top tracks and stores them locally.

Each time you request the same artist, it plays the next track in the list instead of repeating the same one.

Once all tracks are played, it loops back to the beginning.

This creates a natural, DJ-like progression instead of random repetition.
